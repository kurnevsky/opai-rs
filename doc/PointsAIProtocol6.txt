Points AI Protocol, version 6

The communication between the AI and the GUI interface is done via messages to standart input of the AI and messages from standart output of the AI. For example, if AI wants to say something, it must send a message to his standart output. The GUI then must capture this message and analyze it. If the GUI wants to say something, it sends a message to the standart input of the AI.
More precise, every GUI->AI message must have the form: "id command_name arguments\n", and the AI must reply to it with one message of the form: "isOk id command_name arguments\n", where: 
"isOk" is a single letter. It is "=" in case of a success and "?" in case of an error.
"id" is an int. It must be copied by the AI into his reply.
"\n" means "end of line".

Some explanations

* x is a number from 0 to fieldSizeX - 1. For y it's the same, of course.
* color is a boolean value typed as "0" or "1".
* An error message should not contain return arguments.
* If the argument string is returned, it should not contain spaces.
